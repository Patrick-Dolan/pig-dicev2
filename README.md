## Description

A web application where you can play Pig Dice.

Pig dice is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a single dice as many time as they want, adding rolls to a running total, but losing their score for the turn if they roll a one. 

The gameplay can be summarized as:
* If the player rolls a 1, the score nothing and it becomes the next players turn.
* If the player rolls any other number,it is added to their total and the player's turn continues.
* If the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next players turn.
* First player to 100 or more points wins.
